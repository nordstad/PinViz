title: "Wire Visibility - Light & Dark Colors"
board: "raspberry_pi_5"

# This example demonstrates PinViz's dynamic halo color feature that ensures
# all wire colors remain visible against white backgrounds. Light-colored wires
# automatically get dark gray halos, while dark wires keep traditional white halos.
