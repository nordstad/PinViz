# User Guide

Everything you need to use PinViz day-to-day. Choose a path based on what you want to do.

## I want to...

**Generate a diagram from a config file**
→ [CLI Usage](cli.md) — `pinviz render`, output options, themes, complexity limits

**Write or edit a YAML configuration**
→ [YAML Configuration](yaml-config.md) — full field reference, devices, connections, inline components

**Use PinViz from Python code**
→ [Python API](python-api.md) — programmatic diagram creation

**Change diagram colours or use dark mode**
→ [Themes](themes.md) — light/dark themes, wire colour overrides

**Check my wiring for mistakes before building**
→ [Validation](../validation.md) — pin conflicts, voltage mismatches, I2C address collisions

**Connect devices to other devices (not just the board)**
→ [Multi-Level Connections](../multi-level-connections.md) — device-to-device wiring, power chains

**Avoid connecting multiple wires to the same GND/power pin**
→ [Smart Pin Assignment](../features/smart-pin-assignment.md) — `board_pin_role`, automatic distribution

**See complete working examples**
→ [Examples](examples.md) — examples by board, protocol, and feature

**Fix an error I'm seeing**
→ [Troubleshooting](../troubleshooting.md) — common errors and solutions
